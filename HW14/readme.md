# MART 441 Week 14 Homework

I was unable to get the three.js file to load properly from the file that was downloaded.
The OBJLoader and TrackballControls files also had issues.  I went to Github and copied the files from there and it seemed to work, but that took hours!

I can't figure out why the rotation controls won't work.
