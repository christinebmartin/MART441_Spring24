# MART 441 Week 9 Homework

This week was a heavy lift of learning.  I spent WAY too much time trying to figure out why I was getting CORS errors.  I think I created the problem by trying to save the data on my computer rather than reference the webpage where the data was.  

I initially was going to use the flight information data, but I couldn't reference it on my computer and there was a long delay pulling the data directly from the external website.  Due to the delay i chose a different data source.

I added 2 plugins: 1 that animated the button when it is clicked and the other that animates an image when the page loads.
