# MART 441 Week 15 Homework

For some reason this week was the hardest for me to grasp.  I spent hours trying to figure out how to get the information from the playground into my html.  After playing around I found that when I save it an html file is created!!!  

I tried adding texture to the grass, after awhile of playing in the playground I finally gave up.

I used the house and tree models available on the babylonjs website to create the file of houses, a GIANT tree and the sun.  

For the second file, I used the examples provided of a sphere and box and combined those into a single file.
