# MART 441 Week 6 Homework

This week was quite a bit harder, maybe because I've been sick.

I was receiving an error when trying to execute the add player function, the card images wouldn't load.  The error related to the order in which functions were called.  Once i changed things so that the image grid would populate after the DOM was fully loaded, it worked as expected.

I'm sure there's an easier way to do accomplish this, I seemed to be going into a rabbit hole and adding more to accomplish little.
