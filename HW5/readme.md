# MART 441 Week5 Homework

I completely forgot about using the Console for debugging!  The video you shared was a great example!

Spent too much time debugging why images were not showing up on the screen.  After some time I ealized my scrip was running before the html image was available.  Once I moved the script link to the body, AFTER the div class was loaded it worked!

Only 5 of my images were loading.  After debugging I found I had the wrong name.  Once I got 6 images to load I couldn't figure out why they weren't duplicating.  After a bunch of research I was able to find a way to duplicate them using a concatenate method.

I added a consistent image to the front of the cards rather than leaving them blank. Hope this isn't counted against me.
I think it was helpful to get the specifics because it easily got me started rather than being creative to overthink a project and make it super difficult.
