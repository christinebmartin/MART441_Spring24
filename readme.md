# MART 441 Final Project

What a great semester of learning this has been!  I was super hesitant to do this course, but have thoroughly enjoyed it.  Probably the most challenging class I've taken, but the one I've learned the most.  I have appreciated all the videos and assistance throughout the semester.

I've created an online task list where users can add tasks, prioritize and categorize using drop downs and assign a due date.  Users can click on an icon to sort the due date from oldest to latest.  I've added a print button that allows the user to print their to do list.  If the priority of a task is set to HIGH, an exclamation image is shown rather than the word "HIGH".
I struggled with supressing or resizing the checked/unchecked images when printing, and also suppressing the close icon.
I tried putting the task category in a static position, but when i did it moved everything else.
