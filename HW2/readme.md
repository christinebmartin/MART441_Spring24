I spent a good part of my time refreshing my memory on what was covered in MART341. <br/>
I have downloaded the Codeacademy App on my phone which has been a good way to refresh skills.<br/>
I created variables where the list arrays were contained. 
I then combined a heading to the variables.
Lastly, I added commentary on favorite artists.<br/>
I'm still a bit confused as to why something would be written to the Log, but I'm sure this will become more evident as we work through things.<br/>
Including my planning page for Homework 2<br/>

Using ChatpGPT to create the files I found the file to be much more simple than what I created.  I used variables to identify the console log items, however ChatGPT had each one listed: <br/>
// Log your favorite websites
console.log("Favorite Websites:");
console.log("1. ExampleWebsite1.com");
console.log("2. ExampleWebsite2.com");
console.log("3. ExampleWebsite3.com");

If I had used the ChatGPT output I would have accomplished what the assignment required, however it would be quite generic. Because the output was so generic I would have been able to explain the code adequately.  I do not as though this would be reflective of my work though.
