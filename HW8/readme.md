# MART 441 Week 8 Homework

This week is a big shift from the last 7 weeks, and definitely a learning curve.

I spent way too much time trying to figure out why my images wouldn't load.  After 2 days of frustration I realized they were .heic files not jpg.  I used an onlne tool to convert .heic to .jpg and VOILA!!! It worked!

My words fade in, but then change position before fading out.  I realized I had the moveWord function running a second time which caused this.
